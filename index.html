         <h2>Sarcasm</h2>
         <p>I am not explaining sarcasm to you. You have it or you don't.</p>

         <h2>Medical Dramas</h2>
         <p>Dr. McDreamy, Dr.McSteamy, and HUGH LAURIE as Dr. House! YES PLEASE! Stand around and season the pot by yelling loads of medical terminology that you barely understand into it.</p>

         <h2>Kitty Cat Garth</h2>
         <p>A long day at work is quickly washed away with some kitty cat cuddles from my best bud Garth. He was named after Garth Alagar from Wayne's World NOT Brooks.</p>

         <h2>True Crime</h2>
         <p>This is a careful measurement. I would not recommend binge watching Forensic Files more than 5 hours at a time. Doing so will make you suspicious  of everyone in your life.</p>

         <h2>Laughter</h2>
         <p>Laugh directly into the pan you are cooking in because I keep forgetting this is a "recipe". Laughter is achieved by watching funny shows and movies or hanging out with your funny friends.  </p>
